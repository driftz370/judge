## Wave validation

Wave score is just valid if the head judge validates the score, only head judge can make changes to a score before its validation.
"Normal" judge can't edit an inserted wave

## Heat can be restarted

If no one catches a wave during the first 10 minutes of a heat then the Head Judge has the power to restart the heat.

## Interferences

1 interference: heat score will be calculated using only their best scoring wave.
2 interferences: disqualified from the heat

Personas:

- Sufer
- Judge
- Head Judge
